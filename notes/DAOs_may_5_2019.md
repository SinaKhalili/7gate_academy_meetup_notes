# Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
For the _genesis_ :smirk: meetup we decided to discuss DAOs.
>A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by shareholders and not influenced by a central government. A DAO's financial transaction record and program rules are maintained on a blockchain.
## Resources and readings
 - [DAOs, Democracy and Governance](https://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf) by Ralph C. Merkle
 - [MakerDAO whitepaper](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/)

## Discussion 
Primarily we discussed whether DAOs were a good system of governance and whether the prediction market approach which Ralph Merkle lays out in his paper is fundamentally true or not. 

We also discussed some ideas on governance attacks.
